## To Do App
This project lets users add task items to populate a persisting list. Once the task is complete, users can remove the task from the list by pressing a button.

## TicTacToe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

## Pizza
This project is a menu used to order pizza with various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

## Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
